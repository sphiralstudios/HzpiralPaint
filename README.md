# HzpiralPaint

Audio Visualizer based on Hzpiral.

Requires openFrameworks, also fft addon, available at https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFft

Visualizer commands now appear in the app (press spacebar to see them)

Positioning the camera above or below and cranking up the rotation speed creates some pretty cool visual aliasing effects.

Significant frame rate drop if there are too many drop objects on the screen, not yet optimized for performance.

Enjoy!

Lame quicktime screen capture video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPsbTOpXC4I&feature=youtu.be

I highly recommend running the app over watching the video.
